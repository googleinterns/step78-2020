# SchedulR
Capstone Project for STEP by Maceo Thompson, Heidi Johnson, Achilles Ecos

## Overview
Our goal with this project is to help college students find their best-suited course schedule. From personal experience, and the disclosures of our classmates, we know that the process of creating a schedule can be frustrating. Deciding between the different section times for the same course, the many possibilities for optional courses, and the discrepancies between user preferences in the schedule creation process is time-consuming, but our web application will simplify this process. 

## How to use it
1. Fill out the Input Form; this includes filling out courses and their respective section times, as well as the user preferences.

2. Generate all schedules, and browse through the selection of generated schedules in the order of preference based on the user criteria.

3. Select the schedule that you most prefer, and export it using Google Calendar.
